# GitHub Actions Specification (OA-1 & DTU)

This document defines the technical communication flow between the Digital Twin Universe (DTU), the OA-1 Bridge, and the Local Runner.

## System Architecture

The Opposite-Actions (OA-1) system mimics GitHub's pull-based runner architecture. In the local-first environment (DTU), components interaction is defined as follows:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant DTU as DTU (Simulation Server)
    participant Bridge as OA-1 Bridge (Orchestrator)
    participant Runner as OA-1 Runner (Local Agent)
    participant Container as Docker Container

    Note over DTU: State: In-Memory GitHub Mock
    DTU->>Bridge: POST /webhook (workflow_job)
    Note over Bridge: Validate Signature & Queue Job

    loop Every 10s
        Runner->>Bridge: GET /api/jobs?username=peterp
        Bridge-->>Runner: 200 OK [Job metadata]
    end

    Note over Runner: Job Claimed
    Runner->>Container: Spin up (catthehacker/ubuntu)

    Container->>DTU: GET /repos/:owner/:repo/actions/jobs/:job_id
    Note right of DTU: Mirrors GitHub REST API
    DTU-->>Container: 200 OK [Full Job JSON]

    Note over Container: Execute Workflow Steps
```

## 1. Digital Twin Universe (DTU) API

The DTU provides a mirrored GitHub API to ensure that production code running inside containers interacts with a "real" (simulated) GitHub environment.

### GitHub REST API Mirror

**Endpoint**: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/jobs/{job_id}`  
**Source of Truth**: [GitHub REST API Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflow-jobs#get-a-job-for-a-workflow-run)

**Example Response**:

```json
{
  "id": 12345678,
  "run_id": 87654321,
  "status": "queued",
  "labels": ["ubuntu-latest"],
  "head_sha": "d00d1e...",
  "steps": []
}
```

### Internal DTU Seeding

**Endpoint**: `POST /_dtu/seed`  
Used by simulation scripts (`dtu/github-actions/simulate.ts`) to populate the mock server state.

## 2. Automatic Runner Registration

Even if the Bridge says you are "active," GitHub itself won't send the job to your machine unless the official GitHub Actions self-hosted runner application is running and connected to GitHub’s servers.

### The Registration Flow

The OA-1 system automates runner registration using the Bridge as a secure credential manager. This eliminates the need for manual registration tokens.

1.  **Request Token**: The Runner calls the Bridge (`GET /api/registration-token`) before spinning up a Docker container.
2.  **Generate Token**: The Bridge uses its **GitHub App Credentials** to authenticate via the GitHub API and fetch a fresh `registration-token` for the repository.
3.  **Bootstrap**: The Runner injects this token into the Docker container.
4.  **Registration**: The official runner application (`./run.sh`) uses the token to register itself with a unique name (e.g., `oa-runner-1`).

### Required Credentials

For the Bridge to perform this automation, the following environment variables (defined in your root `.env` or Bridge `.dev.vars`) must be configured:

- `GITHUB_APP_ID`: The ID of your GitHub App.
- `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY`: The PEM-formatted private key for your GitHub App.
- `GITHUB_USERNAME`: Your GitHub username or organization name.
- `GITHUB_REPO`: The `owner/repo` string for the target repository.

### Required GitHub App Permissions

The GitHub App must be installed on the repository with at least:

- **Actions**: `Read & write`
- **Administration**: `Read & write`
- **Metadata**: `Read-only`

## 2. OA-1 Bridge API

The Bridge acts as the message queue and presence orchestrator.

### Webhook Ingestion

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/webhook`  
**Description**: Receives `workflow_job` events from GitHub (or DTU).  
**Security**: Validates `X-Hub-Signature-256` using `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

### Job Polling

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/jobs?username={username}`  
**Description**: Runners poll this endpoint to announce availability and retrieve queued jobs.  
**State**: Responding with a list of job metadata (IDs and tokens).

---

## 3. Communication Flow

1.  **Event Trigger**: The `pnpm run simulate:dev` script seeds the DTU mock server with job details and then POSTs a `workflow_job` event to the Bridge.
2.  **Job Queuing**: The Bridge identifies the user, checks if the runner is online, and queues the job metadata.
3.  **Runner Activation**: The local runner, polling every 10 seconds, receives the job metadata.
4.  **Docker Lifecycle**: The runner creates a container. It injects `GITHUB_API_URL` (pointing to the DTU server) and `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
5.  **Direct Pull**: Inside the container, the bootstrap script calls the DTU server directly to fetch its own "Plan" (steps, secrets, etc.).

---

## 4. Why this matters for "Opposite-Actions"

By mirroring the official GitHub API in the DTU, we ensure that:

- **Zero code changes**: The runner container doesn't know it's not talking to GitHub.
- **Local Isolation**: You can develop and test CI logic without any internet connection.
- **Technical Accuracy**: The system follows the exact same pull-based logic as the official GitHub Actions runner.
