# Machinen

**Local-first CI with 1:1 API parity with GitHub Actions.** Intended to be used by AI.

Machinen runs your GitHub Actions workflows locally using the same [official GitHub Action runners](https://github.com/actions/runner) — the exact same binaries that power GitHub-hosted CI. What Machinen emulates is the GitHub.com API itself, so actions like `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`, and `actions/cache` work out of the box without hitting GitHub's servers.

## Why Machinen?

Traditional CI is a fire-and-forget loop: push, wait, fail, read logs, push again. Every retry pays the full cost of a new run.

Machinen runs on the same machine as your code. When a step fails the run **pauses** — the container stays alive with all state intact. Your local edits are synced into the container on retry, so you can fix the issue and **retry just the failed step** — no checkout, no reinstall, no waiting. This makes it ideal for AI agents: point an agent at the failure, let it fix and retry in a tight loop — without the cost of a full remote CI cycle each time.
