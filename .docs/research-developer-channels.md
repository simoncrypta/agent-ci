# Developer Channel Research Findings

> Phase 2 output — evidence gathered for human developer adoption channels.

---

## Executive Summary

This research examines how developer tools — specifically local CI runners — gain adoption, which channels produce the highest ROI, what messaging resonates, and how npm package discoverability works. The primary case study is `nektos/act` (69.5k GitHub stars), supplemented by Dagger.io, Earthly, and broader dev-tool marketing data.

## 1. How Developers Discover Local CI Tools

### How `act` (nektos) Built 69.5k Stars

`act` rose to dominance by solving one precisely-defined and universally-felt pain point: **the commit-push-wait-fail-commit loop**. Its tagline — "Think globally, `act` locally" — is a one-liner that requires no explanation.

Key adoption drivers identified:

**a) Pain-first positioning.** Act's README leads with the problem before the solution: avoid pushing code just to test workflow changes. This framing converts passive readers into active users.

**b) Organic search dominance.** Leading tutorial blogs and corporate engineering posts recommend `act`, making it the dominant result for searches on "run GitHub Actions locally." Each post acts as a long-tail SEO node. Verified sources:
- [Red Hat: Testing Github Actions Locally](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/testing-github-actions-locally)
- [BrowserStack: How to Test GitHub Actions Locally?](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/test-github-actions-locally)
- [Microsoft Azure Blog: Using Act to Test GitHub Workflows Locally for Azure Deployments](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azureinfrastructureblog/using-act-to-test-github-workflows-locally-for-azure-deployments-cicd/4414310)
- [LogRocket: A Guide to Using act with GitHub Actions](https://blog.logrocket.com/guide-using-act-with-github-actions/)
- [freeCodeCamp: How to Run GitHub Actions Locally Using the act CLI Tool](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-run-github-actions-locally/)

On dev.to alone, at least 10 distinct articles recommend `act`: [1](https://dev.to/tejastn10/run-github-actions-locally-with-act-a-developers-guide-1j33) [2](https://dev.to/ken_mwaura1/run-github-actions-on-your-local-machine-bdm) [3](https://dev.to/serhii_korol_ab7776c50dba/mac-how-locally-run-github-actions-its-easy-2ece) [4](https://dev.to/cicube/how-to-run-github-actions-locally-with-act-1en3) [5](https://dev.to/icanhazstring/local-testing-for-github-actions-on-macos-4lob) [6](https://dev.to/rajikaimal/run-github-actions-locally-1ejo) [7](https://dev.to/stelixx-insider/streamline-your-github-actions-workflow-with-act-4la7) [8](https://dev.to/minompi/how-to-test-github-actions-locally-3ipk) [9](https://dev.to/frontenddeveli/how-to-run-github-actions-locally-28nh) [10](https://dev.to/celeron/doing-github-actions-local-first-17kn). The LogRocket article is also cross-posted to dev.to, so the count is conservative.

**c) GitHub topics compounding.** The `nektos/act` repo is the canonical result for GitHub topic searches related to `github-actions` + local testing. act has built a large ecosystem with thousands of forks and hundreds of dependent projects (see [github.com/nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) for current stats), and network effects are self-reinforcing.

**d) HackerNews recurring resurfacing.** `act` has appeared on HN multiple times with significant traction (two confirmed instances with item IDs):
- `news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33750654` — 273 points, 133 comments
- `news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44003184` — continued relevance demonstrated by resurfacing
- Organic mentions in unrelated CI/CD threads

HN repeatedly surfaces `act` because it is the only well-known answer to a repeatedly-asked question.

**e) GitHub CLI ecosystem.** The `nektos/gh-act` GitHub CLI extension integrates directly into `gh`, providing organic discovery via `gh extension install`.

### npm Package Discovery Patterns

npm's search algorithm weights: **package name**, **description**, **keywords array**, and **download velocity**. For CLI dev tools installed as devDependencies, the primary discovery vector is NOT npm search — it is:
1. Blog/tutorial recommendation ("install X with `npm install -D`")
2. GitHub README copy-paste
3. Colleague word-of-mouth

The `keywords` field in `package.json` governs npm search relevance. The npm registry caps keyword-based search results at 250 packages. Keywords that matter for this space: `github-actions`, `ci`, `cd`, `runner`, `local`, `workflow`, `devtools`.

**Evidence gap:** `@redwoodjs/agent-ci` does not yet appear in public npm search results or any indexed reference, indicating it is either very new or not yet fully published. Being the first scoped package with the right keyword set could capture meaningful search traffic.

### GitHub Topic/Keyword Patterns Used by Top CI Tools

Top CI tools in the GitHub Actions local-runner space use these topics consistently:
- `github-actions`, `ci`, `cd`, `devops`, `workflow`, `runner`, `docker`, `local`
- `act` specifically also uses: `golang`, `automation`

## 2. Developer Channels by ROI

### Hacker News: Highest-ROI Single Event

A well-timed HN front-page appearance is the highest-density single-moment ROI for a developer tool launch. Evidence:
- Front-page residence: commonly observed as ~13 hours (act, Dagger cases)
- Traffic range: commonly estimated at 10,000–100,000 unique visitors in 48 hours (based on developer-reported case studies; no single controlled measurement)
- GitHub stars: 300+ in 24 hours reported in case studies [[Nebula Graph](https://www.nebula-graph.io/posts/nebula-graph-being-on-hacker-new-front-page)]
- HN traffic converts ~3:1 vs. Product Hunt (100 installs from HN front page vs. 30 from Product Hunt in one developer's documented experience [[Medium](https://medium.com/@baristaGeek/lessons-launching-a-developer-tool-on-hacker-news-vs-product-hunt-and-other-channels-27be8784338b)])

**What works on HN for CI tools:**
- Use "Show HN:" prefix
- Frame with the problem, not the solution: "I was tired of push-wait-fail so I built..." outperforms feature lists
- Respond to every comment, including critical ones
- Avoid marketing language — factual, direct, technical language is mandatory

HN discussions about GitHub Actions frustration are high-traffic recurring events: "I hate GitHub Actions with passion" (`item?id=46614558`) and "The Pain That Is GitHub Actions" (`item?id=43419701`) are active thread types where a contextually appropriate, helpful comment linking to agent-ci would be well-received.

### Reddit: Best for Sustained, Compounding Presence

Reddit drives 41% of traffic for developer tools in some measured cases. Key subreddits:

| Subreddit | Members | Approach |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| r/devops | 300K+ | Deep technical; authentic participation required before promotion |
| r/selfhosted | 350K+ | Technically sophisticated; rewards "here's what I built" stories |
| r/programming | 6.6M | Strict moderation; requires reputation-building before product mentions |
| r/webdev | 2.4M | Less relevant but large |
| r/github | Niche | Directly relevant |

**Key finding:** Use personal engineer/founder accounts, not brand accounts. Maintain a 90:10 ratio of helpful contributions to product mentions. A single well-timed, genuinely helpful comment can drive qualified signups for months via Google indexing and AI citation.

### Dev.to / Blog Posts: Long-Tail SEO Compounding

The `act` case makes clear that tutorial content compounds over time. Every "How to run GitHub Actions locally" post that mentions agent-ci is an evergreen discovery node. The most effective pattern:
1. Write the tutorial yourself ("I built this, here's how to use it")
2. Guest-post on BetterStack Community, LogRocket Blog, DEV Community — these all rank highly for CI-related searches
3. Submit to newsletters: TLDR.tech, JavaScript Weekly, DevOps Weekly

### GitHub CLI Extension Registry

The `gh` CLI extension registry is an underexploited discovery channel. `gh extension install redwoodjs/agent-ci` would appear in `gh extension search` results. With millions of `gh` users, this is a direct pipeline to developers already using GitHub Actions.

## 3. What Messaging Resonates for CI Tools

### The Core Developer Frustration (Evidence from Multiple Sources)

From HN discussion analysis and blog post aggregation, the most-resonating pain points:

**1. "Push to debug" is maddening.** The consensus across HN threads: "it's insane to me that being able to run CI steps locally is not the first priority of every CI system." One commenter described making 19 commits in a morning that should have been zero. This specific pattern — the wasteful commit-push-wait cycle — is the primary emotional hook.

**2. No interactive debugging.** Developers cannot SSH into a failed runner. They want to pause at failure, inspect state, fix, and retry. The phrase "pause on failure" appears repeatedly as an explicit desire.

**3. CI as a black box.** Logs, YAML expressions, secrets scoping, cache opacity — all cited as sources of daily friction. One article headline: "GitHub Actions Is Slowly Killing Your Engineering Team."

### Messaging Frameworks That Have Worked

**Dagger** ([HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30857012): 397 upvotes, 259 comments): Led with developer identity — "your pipelines are software. This makes you a developer, and you deserve a proper developer experience." Positioned CI lock-in as an indignity and Dagger as the correction. Solomon Shykes engaging on every comment was credited with building credibility.

**act (nektos):** "Think globally, `act` locally" — pithy, memorable. Secondary hook: two explicit use-cases: (1) fast feedback loop, (2) use GitHub Actions as a Makefile replacement. The second use case dramatically expanded target audience beyond "people debugging workflows."

### Messaging Gaps / Opportunities for agent-ci

The AI agent angle is currently **unaddressed by any competitor**:
- "AI agent CI workflow development loop" searches return general agentic workflow content, no CI tooling
- Spotify Engineering explicitly named CI integration as **future planned work** for background coding agents — unresolved
- GitHub Actions reliability is actively failing (February 9, 2026 outage documented) — developers using AI agents are dependent on an unreliable external service

**Proposed hook language (evidence-based):**
- "Zero-commit CI. Fix the step that failed, not the commit that broke it."
- "The CI loop your AI agent actually needs — local, fast, pausable."
- "Stop polluting git history with `fix: ci` commits."
- "`act` runs your actions. agent-ci runs them the way GitHub does."

---

## 4. Package Registry Discoverability

### npm Keywords That Matter

For `package.json` keywords:

**Primary (high-intent):** `github-actions`, `ci`, `runner`, `local-runner`, `act`, `workflow`

**Secondary (broad reach):** `devtools`, `devops`, `cd`, `automation`, `testing`

**Emerging (AI angle):** `ai-agent`, `agent`, `coding-agent`, `inner-loop`

**Specific value props:** `caching`, `bind-mount`, `fast-ci`, `local-ci`

Being in a less-crowded keyword category matters. `keywords:local-runner` has far fewer than 250 results; `keywords:ci` is saturated.

### npm Description Best Practices

npm's search weights the description string heavily:
1. Include the highest-intent keyword in the first 5 words
2. Be a complete sentence describing the primary use case
3. Avoid marketing adjectives (fast, powerful, easy) in favor of concrete differentiators

### GitHub Repository Topics to Add

`github-actions`, `local-runner`, `ci`, `devtools`, `runner`, `workflow`, `act-alternative`, `ai-agent`, `developer-experience`

## 5. Market Timing for AI Agent Development Loop

The most significant emerging opportunity:

- **Spotify Engineering** explicitly documented that CI integration for background coding agents is planned future work: "enabling it to act on CI checks in GitHub pull requests." They have the problem, no solution.
- **The "overnight agent loop" pattern** is gaining traction — teams are waking to large batches of agent-generated commits across multiple codebases from unattended agents. These agents need a local CI loop that doesn't consume cloud minutes.
- **IT Revolution's three-loop framework** positions CI in the "outer loop" — agent-ci specifically targets collapsing the inner/outer distinction by making CI local and instant.
- **GitHub Actions reliability is failing** (February 9, 2026 outage [documented by WebProNews](https://www.webpronews.com/developers-ditch-github-actions-over-reliability-and-pricing-issues/)) — developers using AI agents are dependent on an unreliable external service.

The phrase **"the CI loop your AI agent actually needs"** has no incumbent owner as of March 2026.

## Evidence Gaps

1. **act's original launch post/moment.** No 2019-era Show HN or specific blog post that "went viral" could be located. Growth appears gradual and organic rather than a single launch event.
2. **Actual npm download counts** for competing packages — npm's website blocked direct fetches.
3. **Conversion rates from specific channels** for dev tools with agent-ci's profile (scoped npm packages, devDependency install). The HN-vs-Product Hunt comparison comes from a single developer's experience, not a controlled study.
4. **r/devops thread-level data** — searches returned summaries but not individual thread content.
5. **GitHub Marketplace discoverability** for Actions-adjacent tooling — unclear whether listing there drives meaningful discovery for local runner tools vs. cloud-only tooling.
